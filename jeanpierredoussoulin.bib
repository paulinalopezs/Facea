abstract = "This article proposes a new definition of the circular economy following analysis and comparison of the most prominent concepts of the biosphere: Sraffa’s value theory and Moore’s dialectical method. Our paper helps to identify the positions of each of these concepts with regard to free disposal, waste treatment and surplus distribution value. Thus, we are able to show that the mechanisms of the circular economy function simultaneously as part of the appropriation system and as part of the system for the protection of nature. This study enriches the literature on the circular economy by providing analysis of various scenarios of waste disposal. Finally, areas of application and policy implications of the small wins theory are explored in order to guide future research on the circular economy."

abstract = "The construction sector has long recognised the decisive role of the various phases of the building lifecycle in the global environment. The identification of the construction environmental impacts is a significant progress for the development of a sustainable supply chain related to the raw material consumption and the construction and demolition waste (C&DW) generation. In this sense, circular economics' principles have solid potential to address these challenges in all European Union countries and especially in France. Nowadays, input-output (I/O) modelling covers the analysis of waste generation (WIO). As the supply chain of the building construction process is complex and has several related activities, and in a preliminary moment a conceptual model was developed, this approach provided an assessment of the mitigation actions of C&DW generation in France. This evaluation shows some positive waste reduction of several materials in the construction process, especially in concrete, metal, rock/rubble and sand/soil. However, the same study exhibits that even materials that can be recycled in the construction process, e.g., concrete, plastic, and metal, might not have a positive waste reduction during demolition due to the lack of proper waste separation and contamination during the process."
